    <h2>Executive OT Cybersecurity Leadership</h2>
    <p>Operational technology (OT) environments are the heart of modern industry — powering manufacturing, production, laboratories, and critical infrastructure.</p>
    <p>The Cyber Division of Just Create Labs exists to close that gap — providing expert leadership, strategy, and advisory services tailored specifically for OT cybersecurity needs.</p>

    <h2>Our Flagship Offerings</h2>
    <h3>CISOT™ (Chief of Information Security for OT)</h3>
    <p>Many organizations are now tasking CISOs with responsibility for OT cybersecurity — yet few have the internal expertise to fully address it. The CISOT™ role was designed to meet this growing need: an executive leader focused solely on OT cybersecurity, capable of bridging the worlds of IT, operations, engineering, and business.</p>
    <h3>vCISOT™ (Virtual Chief of Information Security for OT)</h3>
    <p>For organizations not yet ready for a full-time CISOT, our vCISOT™ offering delivers the same strategic leadership on a flexible, fractional basis. Whether launching a new program, advising leadership, or bridging the gap during growth or transformation, a vCISOT™ provides executive expertise precisely when and where it’s needed.</p>
